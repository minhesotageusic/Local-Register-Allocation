# Local-Register-Allocation
<br />
This project was done for Rutgers CS 415 project 1 of Spring semester, 2021.
<br />
Description:
<br />	This project takes an input file containing a sequence of ILOC operations,
<br />	along with k a number of registers for the assumed allocator that will use
<br />	the output modified ILOC file by this project, and the algorithm that will
<br />	handle the register allocation. The desired difference between the original
<br />	file with sequence of ILOC operations and the modified file, is that the
<br />	output file should use no more than k registers as specified by the user.
<br />	This project implements 3 different local register allocation algorithms,
<br />	they are as follow
-		<br /> Bottom-down allocator (designated as b)
-		<br /> Simple top-down allocator (designated as s) (no MAX_LIVE)
-		<br /> Top-down allocator (designated as t)
